# JoraLang

## Overview

JoraLang is my new interpreted language working with a C++ Interpreter. It also offers a easy Shell Terminal interface.

The Interpreter is inspired from my first [GoYa, C++ interpreter](https://github.com/pH-7/GoYa) I did in 2012 but the language, (**[GoYa language](https://github.com/pH-7/GoYa/tree/master/_test)**) was totaly different (and not very readable), that why here I quickly did a simpler language based on a simpler c++ interpreter (kind of lite version). Enjoy :smiley:
